# **💸 SplitWise - Expense Tracker**

## **📋 Project Overview**

This project is an implementation of a **Split-Wise**-like expense management application developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The primary goal of this project is to allow users to manage and split expenses among a group of people, with functionalities for adding groups, managing members within those groups, adding expenses, and viewing expense summaries through graphs.

## **💡 Project Idea**

The idea for this project originated from the need to manage shared expenses among groups, such as friends on a trip or roommates. The goal was to create a user-friendly platform where users could easily add expenses and have them automatically split among group members. The addition of graphical summaries and transaction histories makes it easier for users to track and manage their expenses over time.

## *👷‍♂️Currently working on :

1. Adding members to a group
